This is a simple code I wrote to show my programming skills during a Capital One interview. 

Python code to load, clean, plot, wrangle, and model data of credit card transactions. 
Data has labels indicating whether or not the transaction was fraudulent and the code uses
a random forest classifier to predict which transactions will be fraudulent.
